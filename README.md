# [Project 1: Water Quality Analysis - Using ML to Determine Quality of Water.](https://github.com/uzodyke/Cosmos_Data_Portfolio/blob/main/water_quality_analysis.ipynb)
* We trained a machine learning model to predict the safety of drinking water with a high level of accuracy.
* The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
* The data was cleaned of impurities using Python.
* Pycaret was deployed to give us the best classification methodology with the most optimized predictive accuracy.
